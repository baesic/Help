Hello Project.


[Github for colaborator]

1. git bash
2. ssh-keygen
3. copy content in id_rsa
4. sent to starmomo by facebook message
5. starmomo add SSH keys to member's ssh-key
6. Use github 'pull' and 'push' without username, password.


Then you may do ssh-keygen by git bash in Help(project folder).

When you upload to Github
First, github 'pull' and then you may use 'push' to Github.


Thanks Helper~!
